Tips:

Try to be strategic about how many chocolates you take at each turn. If you take too many chocolates, you may leave your opponent with the last chocolate.
If you are playing against a computer opponent, try to predict what moves it will make. This will help you to make better decisions about your own moves.
Enjoy the game!
